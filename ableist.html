    What does it mean to be ableist?
</h1>
  
  <p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">Ableism is the discrimination of and social prejudice against people with disabilities based on the belief that typical abilities are superior. At its heart, ableism is rooted in the assumption that disabled people require ‘fixing’ and defines people by their disability.<br><br><p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">Personal ableism: Feeling instinctively uncomfortable around disabled people, or anyone who seems “strange” in ways that might be connected to a disability of some kind. This manifests in hundreds of ways, and can include: Being nervous, clumsy, and awkward around people in wheelchairs. Being viscerally disgusted by people whose bodies appear to be very different or “deformed.” Avoiding talking to disabled people in order to avoid some kind of feared embarrassment. Holding stereotypical views about disabled people in general, or about certain sub-groups of disabled people. For example: Assuming that disabled people’s personalities fit into just a few main categories, like sad and pitiful, cheerful and innocent, or bitter and complaining.<br><br><p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;"> Systemic ableism: Laws and regulations that restrict the freedom and equality of people with disabilities. Before laws like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, it was perfectly legal to simply exclude disabled people from government services and employment, going to public schools, and even enter businesses and buy goods and services. And long after those laws removed legal barriers, discriminatory practices continue live on. There are current guardianship laws that are meant to protect people with certain disabilities, but which can easily be misused or overused to restrict freedom and autonomy far more than may be strictly necessary. For example, disabled adults placed under guardianship are often deprived of the right to vote without any real justification, sometimes without their knowledge or even their guardians realizing it. Bits and pieces of otherwise helpful programs often survive multiple efforts at reform, and still impose pointless restrictions and counterproductive inequalities on disabled people. A classic example is Social Security Disability and SSI rules that penalize disabled people for working or getting married.</p>
