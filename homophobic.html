    What does it mean to be homophobic?
  </h1>
  
  <p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">Homophobic people are people with homophobia. The definition of homophobia is the fear, hatred, discomfort with, or mistrust of people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual.<br><br><p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">Homophobia can take many different forms, including negative attitudes and beliefs about, aversion to, or prejudice against bisexual, lesbian, and gay people. It’s often based in irrational fear and misunderstanding. Some people’s homophobia may be rooted in conservative religious beliefs. People may hold homophobic beliefs if they were taught them by parents and families. In its most extreme forms, homophobia can cause people to bully, abuse, and inflict violence on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.<br><br><p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;"> Internalized homophobia refers to people who are homophobic while also experiencing same-sex attraction themselves. Sometimes, people may have negative attitudes and beliefs about those who experience same-sex attraction, and then turn the negative beliefs in on themselves rather than come to terms with their own desires. This may mean that they feel discomfort and disapproval with their own same-sex attractions, never accept their same-sex attractions, or never identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. People dealing with internalized homophobia may feel the need to “prove” that they’re straight, exhibit very stereotypical behavior of straight men and women, or even bully and discriminate against openly gay people.
