    What does it mean to be transphobic?
  </h1>
  
  <p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">The core value underlying all transphobia is a rejection of trans identity and a refusal to acknowledge that it could possibly be real or valid. Transphobia has no single, simple manifestation. It is complex and can include a range of behaviours and arguments. The consequence of transphobia is that trans people struggle to live openly and comfortably in society. An ultimate outcome may be the erasure of trans people as a viable class of people.<br><br><p class="ho" style="text-indent: 50px;">Transphobia can involve name-calling, discrimination and even violence. Find out more about bullying. Transphobia can include deliberate misgendering of people – for example, calling a trans woman (someone assigned male at birth but is female) ‘he’ or even ‘it’ even though the person knows that they are a woman. It can take friends, family and teachers a while to get used to using new pronouns (he/she/they/ze/zir – find out more about gender identity terms) and they might make mistakes, but if they do it deliberately knowing what your pronouns are and knowing that using the wrong ones will hurt you, then that’s transphobia. It can also include discrimination, like not allowing a trans man (someone assigned female at birth but is male) to use the men’s changing rooms. Transphobia often comes from the belief that gender is binary – that people are born male or female and should therefore live their lives as one of those two genders. As well as this, there is the expectation that men and women should like certain things, or dress a certain way, or behave differently. Anyone who doesn’t behave or present in the ‘correct’ way can be subject to name calling, bullying or even violence.</p>
